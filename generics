Generics in TypeScript are a feature that allows you to write reusable code by passing a type as a parameter to another type, whether it's a class, interface, or function. This means that you don't always have to specify the type explicitly when writing code, as you can use Generics to work flexibly with various types without resorting to using ": any."

Key Learnings and Advantages of Generics:

Type Safety: Despite JavaScript being a dynamically typed language, leveraging TypeScript and generics introduces type safety, allowing for error detection at compile time. This fosters the development of more robust and reliable code.

Code Reusability: Generics empower us to create functions, classes, and interfaces that are agnostic to specific data types. This versatility promotes code reuse and minimizes redundancy, resulting in more maintainable and scalable codebases.

Improved Documentation: By employing generics, we enhance the self-documenting nature of our code. Explicitly specifying types makes our code more comprehensible and navigable, benefiting both current and future developers.

Applications of Generics:

However , Generics can be used in TypeScript to create:
Generic Classes.
Generic Functions.
Generic Interfaces.
Generic Methods.
